THIS IS THE GAME OF PAC-MAN CREATED USING JAVASCRIPT ES6
THE GAME CONTAINS THE USUAL OBJECTIVE WHICH IS:
The player controls a character called Pac-Man, a circular, yellow creature with a missing slice, and the objective is to navigate through a maze while eating all the dots (pellets) scattered throughout. The player must avoid four colorful ghosts—Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde—that move around the maze and attempt to capture Pac-Man.
